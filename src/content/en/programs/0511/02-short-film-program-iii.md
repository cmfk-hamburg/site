For writer Proust, the "madeleine" wasn't merely a pastry but a key to his childhood memories. Film, though unable to directly evoke smell and taste, uses audiovisual language to help audiences find their "madeleine" moments! From copied homework to first experiences and shared meals with loved ones. This series explores growth's beauty and pain, with four filmmakers guiding us through its journey with evocative imagery and sincerity.
