Jiang brought Yang Yi around as they hung out together. Though they wandered about aimlessly, Jiang seemed like a key that unlocked a new horizon for Yang's adolescence. But Jiang transferred in the last year of middle school and has never since been mentioned again, though Yang remembers vividly the day before the summer break, as they shared a memorable afternoon in the bright sun and heavy downpour.
