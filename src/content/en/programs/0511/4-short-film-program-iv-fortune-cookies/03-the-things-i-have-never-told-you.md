Unbeknownst to her family, Xinyi (28) is the lone Chinese comedian in Lisbon's English- speaking stand-up comedy scene. The film intertwines Xinyi's on-stage persona and her true self, using first-person narration to unveil the struggles of a female immigrant behind the laughter. The film offers a candid exploration of the intersectionality of her identity, shedding light on the nuanced challenges posed by her gender and ethnicity. Her narrative serves as a poignant reflection of the broader experiences shared by many immigrant women, providing a window into their resilience and the often-overlooked hurdles they confront on their journey to find belonging and acceptance.
