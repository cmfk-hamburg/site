Our body is what we are born with, not something we could choose. But we can imagine another body and come closer to it: we see "Sweat" splashing from one body to another. In "Smoke gets in your Eyes", a corpse is cremated mistakenly and everything related to this body is misplaced. The Mistaking in "the Train of Memories" is a question of gender and sexuality. In the "King of Beasts goes Upstairs", the issue of corporeality becomes essential. A person who has a body can decide to sit at home or stand in the wilderness, with a flashlight illuminating a small area in front of him, surrounded by greater darkness, which is already collapsing. He still decided to walk into this long night. He is seen, chased, waiting to be harmed. The moment of waiting is like falling into a dream.
