Through sweat, I depict the tension between rulers and the ruled, revealing deep-seated class conflicts. Using high-contrast black and white visuals, I emphasize hierarchical disparities. The grimy sweat evokes darkness and discomfort, but ultimately, a clear fluid symbolizes hope and rebirth, highlighting societal struggles and ensuing hope.
