Unlocking a dusty box, a flood of past photos and film. Scanning, editing, playing - the celluloid whirls, window scenes blurring by. My mind races back, to struggles and pain in my search for self. Fragmented memories, collaged frames, daily sounds - a personal film emerges. Seeking solace from bitter times, each moment a kaleidoscope's vibrant shift, a return to childhood's innocence.
