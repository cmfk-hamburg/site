Chinese Film Festival Hamburg is excited to present a special screening event featuring the renowned Chinese film “Beijing Bicycle” in collaboration with the esteemed Warburg-Haus. Since its debut in 2001, “Beijing Bicycle” has received global recognition for its moving depiction of urban life in the Chinese capital. The film follows the intertwined fates of two young men from diverse backgrounds, whose paths cross due to a stolen bicycle. It is regarded as a significant piece in contemporary Chinese cinema, delving into themes of social hierarchy, economic inequality, and cultural evolution within the vibrant metropolis. Recognized for its cinematic excellence, “Beijing Bicycle” has received numerous accolades, including the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2001, followed by a temporary ban from Chinese authorities which was lifted in 2004 after some modifications.

Following the screening, we are pleased to invite you to participate in a discussion led by Hsu Hsiao-ming, one of the film’s producers, film theorist Ruby Chen, and art historians Uwe Fleckner and Yuning Teng from Hamburg University. The discussion aims to offer deeper insights into the film’s conception, themes, artistic vision, as well as its cultural and historical significance.

The event takes place in cooperation with the Warburg-Haus, Hamburg, and the China Academy of Art, Hangzhou. Free event, with no reservation required.
