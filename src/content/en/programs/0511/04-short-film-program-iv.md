Five short films in this program explore sinophone immigrant experiences, and each unveils a unique fortune of diasporic individuals. From vibrant Brooklyn Chinatown to the halls of stand-up comedy in Portugal. From Lowa City then follow the beloved accordion back to the filmmaker's heartfelt hometown in Xinjiang, Ili. Walking into these unfolded narratives, embody the multi-layered identities -gender/sexuality, and an "archive of feelings", we wish you a fulfilling journey.
