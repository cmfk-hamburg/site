I started to re-examine my body.
Taking my own breast hyperplasia as an opportunity, I began to think about what I have experienced as a woman.
'Why do women have to give birth'
'Why menstruation is a shame'
Those "stones" that I perceive as a woman always hurt me.
However, I will keep smashing such stones in this endless cycle of dreams.
Over and over, smash it.
