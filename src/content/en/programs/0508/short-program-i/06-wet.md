This is a work about desire. "Wet" is a work created by the "her" in Rafael's mind. It speaks to Enema's desires and everything that turns her on (and "sexualizes" her), including her desires and fantasies of cooking, rock and roll, fame, fortune, lust, sex, music, drag, etc. The music video features more than seven different looks, including a housewife who loves to cook (and this look was inspired by Freddie Mercury? I Want To Break Free), a subcultural chick who loves to play, an expensive woman who seeks fame and fortune, a celebrity who is obsessed with fame and fortune, a noblewoman who pursues designer brands, a starlet who is bewitched by fame and fortune, a lustful sister who is addicted to the flesh, a fashionable beauty who hides in the toilet for excitement, and the best drag look of pure camp who represents the cutting edge of fashion design in the mainland China.
