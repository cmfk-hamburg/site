"Flower Rain" takes the audience to a microscopic level to observe plants and flowers, employing surreal qualities where luminous flowers drift like nebulae, and transparent petals resemble jellyfish in the depths of the ocean. The energy absorbed by plants from the sun and the earth is projected onto photos, then translated into the film. These images can be seen as a hymn to nature, growing from sunlight and soil.
