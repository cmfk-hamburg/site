"...now I knew that the more the Dinosaurs disappear, the more they extend their dominion, and over forests far more vast than those that cover the continents: in the labyrinth of the survivors' thoughts. From the semidarkness of fears and doubts of now ignorant generations, the Dinosaurs continued to extend their necks, to raise their taloned hoofs, ..." (Calvino, The Dinosaurs)(Academic Screening)

### Guangli Liu & Zirui Chen
Guangli Liu was born in 1990 in Lengshuijiang, China. He currently lives and works in Paris. He graduated from Le Fresnoy - Studio national des arts contemporains in 2020. Guangli's works often emerge from the intersection of different approaches to depicting history and events, and ultimately find their own places in installations, videos, documentaries, and paintings that suggest our understanding of the present is often shaped by pre-existing languages, social norms, and media formats through which pieces of information are transmitted. He won the Golden Nica and Honorary Mention in the Computer Animation category at Ars Electronica (2021, 2022), as well as the Golden Key for Best Short Film at Kassel Dokfest (2021).

Zirui Chen is a media artist. His works are often based on his own identity, talking about historical, political and social issues from the perspective of technology and media, and attempting to connect the complexity between these issues, and beyond the issues themselves, he also tries to make the way in which narratives are constructed visible. His works include experimental videos and installations.
Zirui Chen had his Bachelor's degree in Painting from the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute and his Master's degree from the Haute Ã©cole des arts du Rhin. He is currently enrolled in the Graduate School of the Moving Image at Kunsthochschule Kassel.
