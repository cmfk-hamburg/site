Veronica persica is native to the Caucasus region, located at the border of Western Asia and Eastern Europe. This plant gradually spread from the Caucasus to Europe, Britain, Asia, and China... carried by the wind and migrated by human behavior. In China, it was first discovered and recorded in 1933 and harvested from Wuhan, Hubei. This plant also grew next to the artist's grandmother's former house. After the old house was demolished, Qian unexpectedly found this little blue flower that had accompanied her childhood memories, and still blooming where it once was.

### Qian Han
Qian Han was born in Wuhan in 1993. Qian received her Bachelor's degree from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma, and a dual Master's degree from the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris. Her works have been screened in various institutions, museums and film festivals at both China and overseas.
