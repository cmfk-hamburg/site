We are all immersed in a sense of nostalgia, drawing us back to certain moments of memories and stories. Some of them portray emotions and feelings that are circulated in a narrative of kinship, while others display an ambivalence or in-betweenness embedded in a place that bears witness to a modernization in transition. Nostalgia becomes a site of preservation, as essayistic moving images showcased in this section freeze the ephemerality - that is subtly imprinted both in An Asian Ghost Story and That day, On the River.
