Train attendant Xiao He just quit his job and decided to become a monk. Sometimes in his dreams, he would return to the train from his previous life, on never-ending rails, moving between compartments and entering the memories of the train passengers. 
Deep in the mountains, he will find himself in a cave, where the train that keeps appearing in his memories is becoming increasingly lucid.
Everything that has happened to him is like dots that are connected by a mysterious line, making time seem as if it has never existed at all.

### Ruilan Shen
Now lives and works in Hangzhou. She studied at the China Academy of Art, where she gained an MA. Shen is intrigued by the shared sense of transience between the medium of film and material objects exiled from everyday life. Her work invites the audience for a ghostly wandering in the remains of the visual journeys between eyes and objects. Her artistic practice remakes the moving image, the material space, folk tales and text of her own writing. She was awarded New Asian Currents Awards of Excellence of Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival, Tide Award of the Beijing International Short Film Festival, and selected into Hainan Island International Film Festival, West Lake International Documentary Festival, and CineCina Film Festival amongst others.
