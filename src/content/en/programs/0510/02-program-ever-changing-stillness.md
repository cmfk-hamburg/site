Both films utilize imagery to capture intangible aspects amidst rapid change: space, mental states, societal shifts, emotions, and memories. In "14 Paintings", the fourteen artworks by Dafen Village artists in various spaces portray the reality where artists, originally known for replication, must undergo self-reflection amidst policy changes. The experimental documentary "Trip to Lost Days," intricately woven with Buddhist elements, employs multiple overlapping "still frames" and interplay of light and shadow to depict the train conductor Xiaohe's ethereal journey towards ordination, transcending linear time and space with a fluid existence.
