A fashion commercial crew goes to shoot on the beach, only to discover that the installation built in advance has vanished due to the rising tide. Cal, an art assistant who has just entered the industry, has a strong sense of responsibility and self-esteem, and the task of finding the installation falls to her. Through her efforts, a drone flies out to search for the installation over the sea, while taking her into the unknown. The frantic and futile search is eventually transformed into a poetic and phantasmagorical journey.
