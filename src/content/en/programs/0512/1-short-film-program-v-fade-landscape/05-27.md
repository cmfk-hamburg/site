A coming-of-age short depicts the main character, Yumi and her record store coworker, as they experience existential dread about turning 27 years old, the age that many western rock stars passed. Between daydreaming and questioning their live's direction, the two supervise the record store and its quirky cast of customers and get up to their own shenanigans in the process.
