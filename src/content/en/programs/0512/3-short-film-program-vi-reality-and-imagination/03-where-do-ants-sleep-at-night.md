overline: "Short Film Program VI: Reality and Imagination"
intro: "The four short films in this section explore the interplay of reality and imagination from varied angles. \"A Passing Cloud\" and \"She Should\" illuminate emotional ties in everyday life and the struggle with reality. Meanwhile, \"Where Do Ants Sleep at Night?\" and \"Of Dreams in the Dream of Another Mirror\" prompt reflection on the self-world relationship through abstraction. These films evoke an awareness of life's subtle connections, inspiring profound contemplation of our world."
