intro: "The four short films in this section explore the interplay of reality and imagination from varied angles. \"A Passing Cloud\" and \"She Should\" illuminate emotional ties in everyday life and the struggle with reality. Meanwhile, \"Where Do Ants Sleep at Night?\" and \"Of Dreams in the Dream of Another Mirror\" prompt reflection on the self-world relationship through abstraction. These films evoke an awareness of life's subtle connections, inspiring profound contemplation of our world."

The world is alive, but maybe without mirrors and images, none of it would exist. The blind create images in a different way â€“ with sounds, textures and experiences. They are on the other side of the mirror.

### Yunyi Zhu
Yunyi Zhu (b. 1988) is a Chinese artist whose practice questions memory and perception. He graduated from Tsinghua University Academy of Fine Arts in sculpture and Le Fresnoy - Studio national des arts contemporains, he works based on the combination of a series of personal experiences relating to the uses of some of our underestimated senses in the field of art, such as touch, and the questions of memory. He transforms these experiences and memories into works by various approaches of mediums.
