The five short films depict the journey from the ordinary to the extraordinary from various angles, guiding viewers from familiar paths to uncharted territories. Whether it's unexpected discoveries during a seaside fashion shoot, the ephemeral loss of glory, exploration of inner emotions, or profound observations of daily minutiae, these works illustrate a longing and inclination to transcend the mundane and delve into the spiritual realm.
