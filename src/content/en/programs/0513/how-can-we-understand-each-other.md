In the wake of unprecedented global challenges brought forth by the pandemic, sincere communication appears more difficult than ever. However, the significance of visual storytelling and artistic expression has never been more crucial. Films, arts, and visual explorations serve as bridges across cultures, fostering empathy and understanding.

Based on the platform of CFFH, this panel talk will delve into the current landscape of Chinese experimental and independent films, video arts, and their relation to the social context in China. Speakers will offer insights gleaned from their knowledge, curatorial experiences, and observations pertaining to Chinese contemporary films and art, drawing from past events and the current situation. Through this dialogue, the panel aims to inspire deeper reflection and dialogue on the interaction between art and reality in the post-pandemic world.

Speakers:
Bettina Freimann: Independent Curator, Sinologist, Researcher.
Stefanie Thiedig: Sinologist, Curator, and Founder of Kulturgut 文化财富: Kulturvermittlung in Hamburg und Beijing (https://kulturgut.blogger.de/)
Yuning Teng: Universität Hamburg.
