### About Us

The Hamburg Chinese Film Festival (CFFH) originated from the **Riparian: Chinese Independent Film Showcase Hamburg** project in 2022. Founded by filmmaker **Hanqi Sheng** and artist **Zhichao Zhu**, this project began as a small-scale initiative to screen independent films from or related to Chinese-speaking communities in Hamburg. With the tremendous support of local cultural institutions, what started as an experimental showcase quickly developed into a full-fledged film festival. By the end of 2022, the non-profit organization **Chinesische Medien- und Filmkunst e.V.** was officially established to oversee the festival’s operations and future growth.

The **first edition of CFFH** took place from **January 8th to 15th, 2023**, under the name “CHINESE FILM+: Chinese Film and Video Festival Hamburg.” It featured 9 feature films and 3 short film programs, totaling 12 screenings, 2 roundtable discussions, and a contemporary video art exhibition. The event attracted a diverse audience of film lovers, scholars, and creators, garnering critical acclaim for its focus on artistic and experimental Chinese films. Directors like **Jiang Hongqi**, **Tawfiq Nizamidin**, and **Pepe Danquart** (an Oscar-winning filmmaker) attended the festival and participated in discussions, providing valuable insights to both the public and the festival’s future direction.

The **second edition** was held from **May 8th to 13th, 2024**, expanding both its program and reach. We received over 500 submissions from around the world and curated a selection of 35 films, including narrative features, documentaries, short films, and experimental works. The final jury consisted of **Qiu Jiongjiong**, **Yu Qiong**, **Canan Turan**, and **Jens Geiger-Kiran**, who provided valuable insights and played a crucial role in selecting the winning films. The festival successfully engaged with a broader audience, not only in Hamburg but also attracting visitors from other parts of Europe.

As we look toward the **third edition in 2025**, we are committed to continuing the festival’s mission of fostering dialogue between filmmakers and audiences, and showcasing diverse, innovative voices in Chinese cinema. With expanded programming and even more engagement opportunities, CFFH is poised to become one of Europe’s most prominent platforms for films and visual art from or related to Chinese-speaking communities.
