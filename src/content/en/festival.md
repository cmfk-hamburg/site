The second "Chinese Film Festival Hamburg" embraces the "Film plus" concept, inviting a broad spectrum of Chinese cinema that transcends traditional genres to emphasize independence, art, and experimentation. This edition extends its reach to include all Chinese-speaking regions and teams, introducing a new submission process to uncover works that push creative boundaries. By focusing on innovation and thematic diversity over technical aspects, the festival aims to deepen German audiences' appreciation for the richness and complexity of Chinese films, challenging Orientalist misconceptions and celebrating unique aesthetic expressions and the spirit of independence.

### Our Cinematic Journey

Originating from the Chinese-language independent film screening project "ShowcaseRiparian" (河岸放映), the festival is now organized by the non-profit Hamburg Chinese Film and Media Art Association (Chinesische Medien- und Filmkunst e.V.), continuing our dedication to showcasing the breadth of Chinese cinematic artistry.
