The Chinese Film Festival Hamburg, now in its second edition, is a mesmerising celebration of contemporary Chinese art house cinema. Organised by the non-profit "Chinesische Medien- und Filmkunst e.V" (Chinese Film and Media Art Association), founded in 2022 by filmmaker Hanqi Sheng and artist Zhichao Zhu, this festival goes beyond being just an event. 

It's a vibrant platform that shines a spotlight on emerging talents in Chinese independent filmmaking, offering an authentic portrayal of China's cinematic artistry.

Our festival is a testament to the diversity of cinematic genres, from intricate narratives to impactful shorts, revealing documentaries, imaginative animations, and bold experimental works. We take pride in being a cultural bridge that connects China and Germany, fostering intercultural dialogue and enriching Hamburg's diversity.

In our first film festival, which took place from January 10th to 15th, 2023, under the name of "Chinese Film+." Our Events at Chinese Film+ were met with enthusiastic responses, often selling out to both Chinese and non-Chinese audiences, film critics, and creators in Hamburg and its surrounding areas. Many of the films had their German premiere at our festival, and we even had the privilege of bringing two world premieres to our local audiences.

Join us for this exciting cinematic journey and be part of this remarkable cultural exchange between China and Germany.
