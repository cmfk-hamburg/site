## Chinesische Medien-und Filmkunst e.V

Chinesische Medien-und Filmkunst e.V is a non-profit association founded by SHENG Hanqi and ZHU Zhichao in Hamburg, Germany.

The festival focuses on different types of Chinese language arthouse films and films from other Asian countries. By presenting the works of independent filmmakers and video artists (with post-screening Q & A), the showcase presents an non-biased perspective of contemporary Chinese independent art cinema, provides a field for communication beyond boundaries, and enriches the diverse cultural ecology in Hamburg.

The film festival features monthly screenings at HFBK Kino, and occasional workshops and forums in different urban spaces. The aim is to connect each other through screenings and to encourage free expression through film.

Special thanks to HFBK Hamburg Film Department for their academic and resource support for this event.
